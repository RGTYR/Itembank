            The internet is a useful application that has changed the very fabric of our life in an amazingly short
            time. The internet has been around for quite some time, but it wasn't until the twenty-first century that we
            have witnessed the revolution enabled by the largest computer networks. Then came social media and other
            interactive platforms. The internet and its possibilities paved the way to the world we know today. Life has
            never been the same again. Never before has the effect of the internet been more keenly felt than during the
            current pandemic. We now work, shop and stay connected with the help of the internet. Describe how the
            internet has changed our lives in terms of communications, education, remote working, E-commerce, and
            privacy.
